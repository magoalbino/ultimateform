# Ultimate react hook form (with typescript)

- Building form components with react-hook-form and Material-Ui V5 for upload files (with drag and drop), dynamic fields and input masks 
- Manual input mask (creating a function for each mask in onChange) its not perfect, but it seems more performatic than react-input-mask
- Still needs some layout adjustments

## External libraries

- @mui/material
- react-hook-form ( and @hookform/resolvers )
- yup
- react-dropzone (for file upload)
- react-router-dom (v6)
- sweetalert2

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### "yarn"  to install dependencies

### "yarn dev" to run project with server (available on port 4000)
